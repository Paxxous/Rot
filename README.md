# Rot

Welcome to the sewers, and unkown place that you'll be forced to survive and escape. All while a war is brewing. Will you trust those that trust you? Good and evil isn't as easily traceable as you originally thought.

## Building yourself

There isn't any clear documentation on how to compile the game, since I haven't compiled the first release yet. More documentation coming soon.

Here's just some info on how I compiled the project:

I used SDL2 and SDL_image as well as SDL_mixer for the project. I'm also using visual studio 2022 to code Rot as well.

## Repos' going public ;)

Yep, you heard that right. This repository is going public you probably don't care because this hasn't gone public before. It's just a tiny little game I'm coding
